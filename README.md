INSTALLATION:
===========

### Preferred option (using Git)
(This option does support automatic updating.)

1. Ensure git is installed (and the git executable is in your path).
2. Use git to clone: git clone -b refactor https://github.com/martinpihrt/OSPy.
3. Next use step "Setup"

### Second option (without Git)
(This option does *not* support automatic updating.)

1. Download a copy of the program from https://github.com/martinpihrt/OSPy/archive/master.zip.
2. Extract the contents to a location of your choice.

## Setup
A setup file has been provided to help you setting up your environment to contain all required packages.
This setup also helps you in case you want to run the program as a service (on Raspbian).

1. Go to the folder where the setup.py file is located (cd OSPy).
2. Execute: sudo apt-get update and follow the procedures
3. Execute: sudo apt-get upgrade and follow the procedures
2. Execute: sudo apt-get install python-setuptools and follow the procedures
2. Execute: python setup.py install
3. Follow the procedures of the script.

## For enable I2C device (LCD plugin and more I2C plugins)  
1. Execute: sudo nano /etc/modules
2. Add in to the file:  
i2c-bcm2708  
i2c-dev  
3. Execute: sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf  
4. Change to:  
#blacklist spi-bcm2708  
#blacklist i2c-bcm2708  
5. Execute: sudo apt-get install python-SMBus  
6. Execute: sudo apt-get install i2c-tools  
7. Reboot OS system: sudo reboot
8. Try find I2C devices: sudo i2cdetect -y 1 (for RPi-1 HW sudo i2cdetect -y 0)
